							<p>I graduated from Alpharetta High School in 2019 and have experience in fields such as Computer Science and Engineering. </p>

								<p> I founded a company that focuses on productivity applications in 2020, named tal-labs with 4 different software engineering students at my school. Tal-labs is a company that develops applications to help people achieve their dreams by getting a hold of their hectic schedules and time limits.</p>
								
								<p>I worked for companies from various fields. I interned for one of the biggest banks in the world from Turkey, Türkiye İş Bankası as a payment processing systems intern. I also work at a startup (uVox) which is a platform to share multimodal (text with audio) media as a backend engineering intern. In addition to all of these, I teach at an after-school academy as a Python teacher.</p>
